    "All of the named distributions that we'll encounter in this book have been implemented in R, but in this Python-based notebook we will use their equivalents in SciPy. In this section we'll explain how to work with the Binomial and Hypergeometric distributions in [`scipy.stats`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/stats.html). We will also explain in general how to generate r.v.s from any discrete distribution with a finite support. The aforementioned Statistical functions (`scipy.stats`) page is a handy list of the distributions in `scipy.stats`. Typing `scipy.stats.[distribution].__doc__` will display more information on the named distribution.\n",
